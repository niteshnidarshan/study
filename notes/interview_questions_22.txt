Streams in Java
- Stream API is used to process collections of objects.
A stream api is a sequence of objects that supports various methods which can be pipelined to produce the desired result.
-  A stream is not a data structure instead it takes input from Collections, Arrays or I/O channels.
- Streams don't change the original data structure, they only provide the result as per the pipelined methods.
